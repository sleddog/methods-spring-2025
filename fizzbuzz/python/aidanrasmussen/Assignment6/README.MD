# BobcatBuzz API

This API runs the **BobcatBuzz** algorithm, where:
- For numbers divisible by 3: "Bob"
- For numbers divisible by 5: "Cat"
- For numbers divisible by both 3 and 5: "BobCat"
- Otherwise, returns the number itself.

This can be ran with curl or through a browser

I attempted to use Docker and Kubernetes on my local machine but got an error that I wasn't able to fix. Not sure why it didn't work.
